# Introduction to C

## 1. Header files
It is very important to have header files. These files are very important files that include your functions for example, the stdio.h file, a common file used in every 
.c program file contains statements like your printf() fucntion that prints.
### How do I put header files in my c programming folder?
It's very simple, it's just this syntax.
#include <headerfilename.h>
In the case of the stdio.h file, do the following code.

    #include <stdio.h>
    
### Why is it important to always declare the header file?
Very well, try and leave out the include statement and compile and run your program see what happens.
A warning appears. Still can run not bad. Why is it still very important? 
The header file here, stdio.h is very important in supporting the input and output.
